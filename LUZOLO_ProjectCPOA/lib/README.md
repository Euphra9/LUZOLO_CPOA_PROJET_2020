# XieLuzoloQuan_cpoa_td2
there are Some details about td3 and td4ï¼š

As for the test part of td3: 
euphraLUZOLO is responsible for the test of the "listememoire", 
JingyiXIE is responsible for the test of the "metier" (modele), 
Quan is responsible for the test of the "sql" and the final integration and debugging.


The result is: 
there are still some classes that have not passed the test, 
they are: MySQLDaoCategorieTest, ListeMemoireClientTest (only update function) and ListeMemoireCategorie (only update function)
The rest all pass the test.


As for td4:
Successfully implemented the FX interface.
JingyiXIE is responsible for SceneBuilder(view),
Quan is responsible for the rest(Configuration environment,Controller and Model)
In order not to affect the previous code, I made a new class for model_produit (Produit_TD4).
